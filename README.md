# password-generator

## Description
I was tasked with this project to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
