## Description
I was tasked to create a timed quiz on JavaScript. The goal is to store high scores so that someone can compare that to someone taking the quiz. When someone clicks the "start" button, a timer will start and be presented with a question. When the question is answered, another question will display. Incorrect answers will have time subtracted from the clock. The quiz will be considered over when the timer reaches 0 or when all questions are answered. A user will be able to submit and save their score by inputting their initials.
